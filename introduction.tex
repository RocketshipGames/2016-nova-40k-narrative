\chapter{Introduction}

Welcome to another year of the NOVA \textit{Warhammer 40,000}
Narrative!

The NOVA 40k Narrative is a high quality wargaming experience based on
an ongoing story in an original science fiction universe.  It is
team-centric, with players organizing into two alliances and
collectively making strategic decisions such as match pairings and
targets.  Most importantly, it is a narrative campaign, not a
tournament.  Stellar play and notable achievements are recognized, but
the focus is on social gaming with a strong narrative tilt.  Missions
aren't necessarily symmetric, and some of them aren't even fair.
Opponents also may or may not be working toward covert objectives of
which you're not even aware, or have a secret resource or stratagem
that they or their alliance won in earlier battles.  If your driving
motivation is competition and winning games, this event is not for
you.  If your main interest though is having fun, playing good games
with great people, and making your mark on a multi-year story built by
hundreds of fellow 40k gamers, then this is where you want to be
September 1--4, 2016.

Going into its fifth year, our player-created storyline continues with
The Virtue suffering the after-effects of its failed assault on Earth,
defeated by Humanity over the course of the previous events.  Whether
you're a new rookie or a returning veteran: Strap in, check your ammo,
and brace for impact---eons old, galaxy spanning civilizations don't
change easily.  Join us now for the 2016 NOVA 40k Narrative:

\section{Updates}

This year's 40k Narrative is going to continue the things you love
about it.  But a number of changes and improvements are also being
made.  Primary gameplay updates of which to be aware include the
following:

\begin{itemize}
%\item The opposing sides in the story have broadened.

%\item Registration will be simplified and balancing of the sides
%  improved, with players signing up for the event as a whole and then
%  joining a side on opening night.

\item Codex-specific Narrative Supplements have been dropped.  They're
  too unwieldy to balance and maintain under Games Workshop's current
  hectic release schedule, as likely to imbalance armies as balance
  them, and skewed registration toward one or the other side in order
  to get specific boosts.

% \item Players will instead customize their armies through selecting a
%   Technical Skill, such as Field Medicine, Electronics, or
%   Assassination.  These will provide small, thematic in-game boosts;
%   notable advantages toward specific narrative mission objectives; and
%   a player-specific campaign progression.

\item Not everyone will be playing the same mission in each round,
  instead choosing from several options to meet the strategic needs of
  their side and to best match their style and army list.

\item Superheavy vehicles and gargantuan creatures with at most~9
  HP/Wounds are permitted.

\item An optional Quick Reaction Force detachment is made available to
  use in army lists.

\item New Fame and Infamy mechanics have been introduced.
\end{itemize}
