  After all deployment concludes, randomly select a table corner.
  Place a flying shuttle marker~12''x12'' from that corner, adjusting
  its position by the minimum necessary toward table center to not
  overlap models or impassible terrain.  Models may move under the
  shuttle model and even over or onto its base, but flying models may
  not move through the marker model itself.

\begin{missionrules}
  \nightfighting

  \missionsubheading{Shuttle Crash.} At the start of game turn~2,
  either player rolls a~D6.  On a~1--2 the shuttle marker scatters
  toward the diagonally opposite table corner, on a~3--4 it scatters
  toward the center of one of the farther opposing table edges, and on
  a~5--6 it scatters toward the center of the other farther opposing
  table edge, like so:

  \missionsubheading{Debris.}  Any uncontested debris marker that
  begins the movement phase in base contact with at least two infantry
  models from a single unit may be carried up to~6'' by those models
  as they move, ending the move in base contact with both models.
  Designate two before moving if there are multiple models in base
  contact.  No unit can carry more than one debris marker at a time,
  and any unit that carries a debris marker cannot run or charge that
  turn.  Debris markers may embark and disembark a transport or
  building with their carrying models; they are considered bulky.  In
  no case can a debris marker move more than~6'' in the movement
  phase, or move at all in any other phase.  In the rare chance that a
  carrying model is removed as a casualty while moving, i.e., by
  moving in dangerous terrain, the marker is placed where the final
  wound occurred.

  At game end, the wreckage marker is worth~3 victory points.  Each
